# C++ Memory Allocator

Script to review how to build a custom memory allocator and some other memory related stuff... 

(in C++ ofc)

## Topics Covered
- Custom Memory Allocator Building -> `allocator.cpp`
- Basics on how the "new" operator works
- Memory Heap v Memory Stack
- Pass by value, by reference, by address (pointer)

## Aclarations
I use Visual Studio Code in a Windows machine. So I run the scripts by compiling it with `gcc compiler`.
